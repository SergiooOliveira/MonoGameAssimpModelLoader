# MonoGame Assimp Model Loader And Model Class
A repo for work on a open assimp dot net model loader and model class for the MonoGame framework library.

This is a work in progress while it basically loads and displays some animated models. 
It is currently in what id call a prototyping phase. 
Tons of stuff needs to still be done.
At the moment its pretty raw and somewhat a mess.

Current keyboard commands 
.
F5 for wireframe 
F6 to view the Normals.
R begins the animation F stops it.
Q thru C and the Arrow keys all have different functions for moving the camera around.
qe forward back the arrows are strafing movement zc roll and aswd are look at keys.
.

Future plans later down the road is to add a few things to edit the models if possible.

* Animation edit to add to or edit animations.

* A bone edit to add bones.

* ReScaler to Scale all models to a initial size.

* Subdivision tesselator to lower or increase the lod of a model.

* Id like to also find a way to import bvh data for animations probably beyond me atm.

* In some manner ill probably add a way to turn the model into a simpler data structure a xnb or dat file.

  So that this whole thing may just become a intermediate converter in the end.
